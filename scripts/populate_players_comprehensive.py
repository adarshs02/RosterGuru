"""
Comprehensive Players Table Population Script

This script:
1. Fetches ALL NBA player IDs from NBA.com (not just stats API)
2. Fetches all ESPN player IDs and positions from ESPN API
3. Matches players between NBA.com and ESPN using normalized names
4. Outputs to CSV for the players table with both NBA and ESPN IDs

Fields output: player_id (UUID), nba_player_id, espn_player_id, player_name, position
